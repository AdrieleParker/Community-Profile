<h1>Black Social Users</h1>

<p>Weâ€™re focusing on two separate, but potentially overlapping communities: Black millennials impacting social change through social media and African Americans suffering from depression.</p>

<p><strong>Black Mental Health Intro:</strong> Despite representing only a small fraction of the population, African Americans currently account for 18.8% of Americans suffering from a mental illness. The idea of mental illnesses and mental health within the Black community has historically been considered taboo. With the rise of the â€œnewâ€ civil rightsâ€™ era, high rates of low income and homelessness, drug use, and other factors affecting the Black community, it is important now more than ever to acknowledge the existence of mental illness and end the stigma.</p>

<p><strong>Black Social Change Intro:</strong> There are many social issues impacting the Black community -- including racial profiling, police brutality, the endangerment and everyday racism -- sparking the Black Lives Matter Movement, the current Civil Rights Movement, with the power of social media activism. Black millennials and activists are influencing these movements and proving how social media is imperative to sparking social change. We are in the process of finding data on Black Twitter's activism growth and how it can impact activism in the streets.</p>

<p>Due to recent research and interviews intersecting with the "Info Gathering and Reporting" class, thereâ€™s a need to bridge together the gap of the Black Lives Matter Movement with how other Black communities (black trans/cis people, Black gays and lesbians and Black women) face social issues that threaten their lives, but go unnoticed, overall, and how they can be included within this movement. Therefore, we are seeking out data on these Black millennials who face issues not included within the community's movements.</p>

<h2>Dataset #1:</h2>

<p>Our initial data and research indicates that Black millennials rule Twitter and use it as a major platform for social awareness and activism. Thus far, we have found data on Black social users compared to White social users as well the social media use of Black youth. Also, we found out there are Black Twitter users who are not advocates, but could be included within the community and its movements. Also, we found a map of where the most Black Twitter users are located.</p>

<p>Black Twitter provides Black millennials with a platform to highlight commentary and in-depth, thought-provoking conversations about taking action and advocating for issues that are impacting the Black diaspora.</p>

<p>Like Deron mentioned in his week one blog post, Pew Research Center studied Black versus White Internet usage. The study organized the demographics into different areas of the Internet and technology, recently in January 2014.</p>

<p>This dataset breaks down specific demographics within the Black and White demographics. But overall, the Black demographic uses Twitter at 22 percent and the White demographic uses Twitter at 16 percent.</p>

<p>Also, the chart breaks down demographics with race in conjunction with gender, age, income and education.</p>

<p>Pew Research Center conducted another study about the demographics of key social networking platforms a month prior, but the chart above organized and broke down each demographic more efficiently.</p>

<h2>Dataset #2:</h2>

<p>Source: http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/01/06/detailed-demographic-tables/</p>

<p>Black and White demographics use social media networks -- like Facebook, LinkedIn and Google Plus -- at a closer percentage. Although White social users use these social platforms at 1 percent lesser than Black social users, who are at 73 percent. Itâ€™s interesting to see closer numbers in usage of these social platforms compared to Twitter. This means Black millennials found more of a voice on Twitter for activism and community compared to other platforms.</p>

<h2>Dataset #3:</h2>

<p>Source: http://www.pewinternet.org/2013/03/13/main-findings-5/</p>

<p>Black teens might not have as much access to the Internet and technology as their White counterparts. Nevertheless, 64 percent of Black teens own a computer. This is compared to 81 percent of White teens, but Black teens utilized social media much more, which indicates they have a presence Black Twitter activism can influence.</p>

<h2>Dataset #4:</h2>

<p>Source: http://www.pewinternet.org/2013/05/21/teens-social-media-and-privacy/</p>

<p>Like the previous dataset from Pew Research Center, Black Internet users are more likely to use Twitter. Pew highlighted Black Twitter youngsters use the platform more than their White counterparts. This study published in May 2013 said 39 percent of Black teens use Twitter compared to 23 percent of White teens.</p>

<h2>Dataset #5:</h2>

<p>According to Language Jones, this map shows the location of Black folks tweeting. The study goes on to explain there isn't one Black Twitter focused on activism; there's another community of Black Twitter who who use a different dialect -- like "nun," "nuttin" and "nuffin" as #blackfolksslang.</p>

<p>Due to their being different Black Twitter communities, we pose the question how can socially-conscious Black millennials interact with Black social users who use slang dialects?</p>

<h2>Dataset #6:</h2>

<p>Source: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4279858/table/T2/</p>

<p>The link above shows data from a 2013 study conducted by researchers from the University of Wisconsin. The study surveyed and analyzed 272 community-based African Americans aged 25-72. This data is important as it provides insight on beliefs, attitudes, and coping mechanisms that African Americans have towards mental illnesses.
Of the coping mechanisms that were presented to the group â€“ professional help, informal support network, religiosity, and avoidance â€“ it was found that religion was the preferred choice for both men and women, followed by informal support, professional help, and avoidance. Knowing the communityâ€™s treatment preferences allows us to not only appeal to their interests (for e.g. we could collaborate with a religious group to build a campaign), but provides us with a starting point for seeking out members of this community that are afflicted by depression.</p>

<h2>Dataset #7:</h2>

<p>Source: http://aspe.hhs.gov/health/reports/2012/uninsuredintheus/ib.cfm
Healthcare coverage is still a major issue in the United States, despite Obamacare going into effect. Table 1 at the link above shows uninsured rates by age, race, and household income as of 2011. We can see that Blacks (including African Americans) make up approximately 13.1% of the Total Population, yet their uninsured rate is the second highest at 19.5%.
From the data we can also see that income and age play a significant role in the uninsured rate. This data is important as it provides a starting point for investigating what healthcare coverage, or lack thereof, is in place for the African American community. It also prompts the question of whether or not current insurance plans include coverage for adequate mental healthcare.</p>

<h2>Dataset #8:</h2>

<p>Source: http://www.cdc.gov/mentalhealth/data_stats/depression.htm</p>

<p>The chart at the link above indicates that 1 in 20 Americans over the age of 12 are currently suffering from depression. Most importantly the chart shows that non-Hispanic Blacks have the highest rate of depression. Teens, millennials, and those 60 years of age and older have significantly lower rates of depression than middle age Americans. Women also have significantly higher rates of depression than men. Beyond race, age and gender must also be considered, as it will drastically affect the manner in which the community is approached.</p>

<h2>Dataset #9:</h2>

<p>Source: http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5938a2.htm</p>

<p>Looking at the results from Table 1 of the link above from a 2006-2008 study conducted by the CDC using a phone-based survey, we see that non-Hispanic Blacks have the highest rates of meeting the criteria for any type of depression at 12.8%. This dataset is significant and differs from the previous dataset, as it differentiates between major depression and other types of depression. While the rates of major depression are significant at 4%, those Blacks suffering from other forms of depression is at a high of 8.7% -- significantly higher than any other group. It is important to dig deeper and find out what other forms of depression exist and how/why they are currently impacting the Black community in the way that they are.</p>

<h2>Dataset #10:</h2>

<p>Source: http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/prevalence/major-depression-among-adults.shtml</p>

<p>The dataset on the above link is from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). It provides fairly recent (2012) information on the prevalence of Major Depressive Episodes among U.S. adults. NIMH describes a Major Depressive Episode as:</p>

<p>â€œA period of two weeks or longer during which there is either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure, and at least four other symptoms that reflect a change in functioning, such as problems with sleep, eating, energy, concentration, and self-image.â€</p>

<p>While the data shows that Blacks are below average for experiencing Major Depressive episodes over a 12 month span, the chart fails to explicitly show the differences in population sizes of the various ethnic groups. American Indian/Alaska Natives are indicated as having the highest percentage of major depressive episodes, however they only account for 1.2% of the overall US population. It would be interesting to dig deeper into this data to establish the raw numbers that account for depressed individuals based off of the ethnic makeup of the population.</p>
