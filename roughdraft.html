<h2>Intro:</h2>
<p>We’re focusing on two separate communities: The level of black social media usage across platforms and African Americans suffering from depression.</p>

<p><strong>Black Mental Health Intro:</strong> Despite representing only a small fraction of the population, African Americans currently account for 18.8% of Americans suffering from a mental illness. The idea of mental illnesses and mental health within the Black community has historically been considered taboo. With the rise of the “new” civil rights’ era, high rates of low income and homelessness, drug use, and other factors affecting the Black community, it is important now more than ever to acknowledge the existence of mental illness and end the stigma.</p>

<p><strong>Black Social Users Intro:</strong> Black activists influence social change using Twitter and other social media platforms. There are many social issues impacting the Black community -- including racial profiling, police brutality, the endangerment of black lives, taboo social issues and how the Black Lives Matter Movement can be inclusive of all black lives. Our data is not focused on how black social media users influence activism because it’s extremely hard to find, but we’re simply focusing on the level of black social media usage across platforms.</p>

<h1>Black Social Users</h1>

<h2>Dataset #1 - Twitter Users by Ethnicity in 2014:</h2>
<p><a href=”http://www.statista.com/statistics/265646/share-of-us-internet-users-who-use-twitter-by-ethnic-background/”>Source: Pew Research Center</a></p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/RPYyopl"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/RPYyopl.png" title="source: imgur.com" /></a></p> 

<p>The share of Twitter users of all Internet users is the most recent study conducted by Pew Research Center on social media usage by ethnicity. Compared to White (non-Hispanic) at 21 percent and Hispanic at 25 percent, Black (non-Hispanic) people use Twitter at 27 percent -- the highest of any other ethnic group in the U.S.</p>


<h2>Dataset #2 - Reddit Users by Ethnicity in 2013:</h2>

<p><a href=”http://www.statista.com/statistics/261770/share-of-us-internet-users-who-use-reddit-by-ethnicity/”>Source: Pew Research Center & American Life Project</a></p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/xsq5a2w"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/xsq5a2w.png" title="source: imgur.com" /></a></p>

<p>The share of Reddit users of all Internet users is an interesting study to chart compared to Twitter. Black social users use the platform, which is for community forums, a little less than White social users. Clearly, Black social users use other social platforms more often than Reddit. White social users use the platform at 5 percent; Black social users use it at 4 percent; and most interesting enough Hispanic social users use it the most at 11 percent.</p>



<h2>Dataset #3 - Twitter & Other Social Users by Ethnicity & Gender in 2013:</h2>

<p><a href=”http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/01/06/detailed-demographic-tables”>Source: Pew Research Center</a></p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/JVuOpsp"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/JVuOpsp.png" title="source: imgur.com" /></a></p>

<p>Our initial data and research indicates that the Black social users rule Twitter. The data is on social users of all Internet users by ethnicity (Black and White) and gender. The data compares Twitter and other social platforms (Facebook, LinkedIn and Google Plus) usage of Black males and White males, and Black females and white females in 2013.</p>

<p>Broken down are the specific demographics within the Black and White demographics. But overall, the Black demographic uses Twitter at 22 percent and the White demographic uses Twitter at 16 percent.</p>

<p>Pew Research Center conducted another study about the demographics of key social networking platforms a month prior, but the chart above organized and broke down each demographic more efficiently.</p>
<p>Black and White demographics use social media networks -- like Facebook, LinkedIn and Google Plus -- at a closer percentage. Although White social users use these social platforms at 1 percent lesser than Black social users, who are at 73 percent. It’s interesting to see closer numbers in usage of these social platforms compared to Twitter.</p>

<p>Overall according to the 2013 study, Black males use Twitter at 21 percent and other social platforms combined at 71 percent. White males use Twitter at 18 percent and other social platforms combined at 66 percent. Black females use Twitter at 22 percent and other social platforms combined at 74 percent. White females use Twitter at 15 percent and other social platforms combined at 77 percent.</p>

<h2>Dataset #4 - Teenage Twitter Users by Ethnicity in 2012:</h2>

<p><a href=”http://www.statista.com/statistics/184322/usage-of-twitter-among-us-teenagers-by-ethnicity/”>Source: Pew Research Center</a></p>



<p><a href="http://imgur.com/Hg4l1Wg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Hg4l1Wg.png" title="source: imgur.com" /></a></p>


<p>The share of teenage Twitter users of all Internet users in 2012 breaks down the amount of youth by ethnicity. Black (non-Hispanic) teenagers used Twitter the most at 39 percent. White (non-Hispanic) teenagers use Twitter at 23 percent; and Hispanic teenagers use Twitter at 19 percent -- the lowest out of any other teenage group in the U.S.</p>


<h2>Dataset #5 - Distribution of Twitter Employees in the United States in 2014, by Ethnicity and Department:</h2>


<p><a href=”http://www.statista.com/statistics/313710/twitter-employee-ethnicity-and-department-us/”>Source: Twitter</a></p>


<p><a href="http://imgur.com/YSq6phx"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/YSq6phx.png" title="source: imgur.com" /></a></p>


<p>The share of Twitter employees in the U.S. in 2014 by ethnicity and (tech, non-tech and leadership) department(s) is an unique study. Twitter conducted its own study on the distribution of employees across departments. This study is broken down by many ethnicities. White employees dominate Twitter usage in tech, non-tech and leadership at 58, 60 and 72 percent. Black employees are much lower in percentage at 1 percent for tech, 4 percent for non-tech and 2 percent for leadership. Other people of color’s percentages across departments are very similar to that of Black employees.</p>

<h1>Black Mental Health</h1>

<h2>Dataset #6 - African American Attitudes towards Mental Illnesses</h2>

<p><a href=”http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4279858/table/T2/”>Source: University of Wisconsin African American Mental Health Study</a></p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/w0wsB56"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/w0wsB56.png" title="source: imgur.com" /></a></p>

<p>In 2013 researchers from the University of Wisconsin conducted <a href=”http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4279858/”>a study</a> with 272 community-based African Americans aged 25-72. The purpose of the study was to provide insight on beliefs, attitudes, and coping mechanisms that African Americans have towards mental illnesses.</p>


<p>Of the coping mechanisms that were presented to the group – professional help, informal support network, religiosity, and avoidance – it was found that religion is the preferred choice for both men and women, followed by informal support, professional help, and avoidance.</p>

<p>In a <a href=”http://www.pewforum.org/2009/01/30/a-religious-portrait-of-african-americans/”> 2009 Pew study</a> on religion, it was determined that nearly eight out of ten, or 79% of African-Americans consider religion an important aspect of their lives.</p>

<p>Following the data, it would be appropriate to provide mental health care through religious outlets. Many churches have already begun doing this. For example, the <a href=”http://www.memphishealingcenter.com/emotional.html”>Memphis Healing Center</a> has several “mental fitness centers” around the Memphis area. These facilities combine traditional mental health treatment techniques with spiritual healing.</p>

<p>Additionally, In 2004 Laverne Williams, CSW created the Promoting Emotional Wellness and Spirituality (PEWS) program with funding from the New Jersey Department of Mental Health Services (NJDMHS). PEWS exists to not only educate the clergy on mental illness, but to also end the stigma and promote treatment within the community.</p> 

<p>In April 2014 an <a href=”http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00981389.2014.880391”>article</a> by Williams and two of her colleagues was published in the academic journal, Social Work in Health Care. The article outlines the benefits of the PEWS program and provides an overview of their training curriculum for churches. While funding was cut short on the program, and long-term research on it’s effectiveness hasn’t been determined, short term results proved the program to be useful.</p>

<h2>Dataset #7 - Uninsured Rate by Ethnicity</h2>

<p>Source:<a href=”http://aspe.hhs.gov/health/reports/2012/uninsuredintheus/ib.cfm”>Source:  U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Population Survey</a></p>


<a href="http://imgur.com/T8Qmu8e"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/T8Qmu8e.png" title="source: imgur.com" /></a>

<p>Healthcare coverage is still a major issue in the United States, despite Obamacare going into effect in early 2010. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services keeps track of the uninsured. Blacks make up approximately 13.1 percent of the Total Population, yet their uninsured rate is the second highest at 19.5 percent.</p>

<p>Knowing uninsured rates provides us with a starting point for investigating what healthcare coverage, or lack thereof, is in place for the black community. It also prompts the question of whether or not current insurance plans include coverage for adequate mental healthcare.There are a number of mental health treatment facilities that accept government sponsored insurance plans, and there are also many that accept payments on a sliding scale based on income. Spreading awareness of affordable treatment options is key to improving such a major issue. Using the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s treatment <a href=https://findtreatment.samhsa.gov/”> facility finder</a>, people can search for facilities in their area by insurance and payment type accepted.</p>

<h2>Dataset #8 - Persons with Depression, 12 Years & Older</h2>

<p><a href=”http://www.cdc.gov/mentalhealth/data_stats/depression.htm”>Source:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Depression Data </a></p>

<a href="http://imgur.com/J489Ebr"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/J489Ebr.png" title="source: imgur.com" /></a>

<p>Depression is one of the most common forms of mental illness with 1 in 20 Americans over the age of 12 currently suffering from it. Non-Hispanic Blacks have the highest rate of depression. Community environmental factors and socioeconomic difference, increase the likelihood of developing a mental health issue.</p>

<p>While depression is one of the most common forms of mental illness, it is treatable – people just need to seek adequate treatment, which is of course easier said than done.</p>

<h2>Dataset #9 - Adults Meeting Criteria for Depression</h2>

<p><a href=”http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5938a2.htm”>Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  Current Depression</a></p>

<a href="http://imgur.com/NQ1ZZ3r"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/NQ1ZZ3r.png" title="source: imgur.com" /></a>

<p>In a 2006-2008 study conducted by the CDC, using a phone-based survey, non-Hispanic Blacks have the highest rates of meeting the criteria for any type of depression at 12.8 percent. The study, unlike many others differentiates between major depression and other types of depression. While the rates of major depression are significant at 4 percent, those Blacks suffering from other forms of depression is at a high of 8.7 percent -- significantly higher than any other group.</p> 

<h2>Dataset #10 - Major Depression Among Adults
</h2>

<p><a href=”http://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/2k12MH_Findings/2k12MH_Findings/NSDUHmhfr2012.htm”>Source: Samhsa.gov</a></p> 

<a href="http://imgur.com/gCi7ehD"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/gCi7ehD.png" title="source: imgur.com" /></a>

<p>The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) provides fairly recent (2012) information on the prevalence of Major Depressive Episodes among U.S. adults. NIMH describes a Major Depressive Episode as:</p>

<p>“A period of two weeks or longer during which there is either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure, and at least four other symptoms that reflect a change in functioning, such as problems with sleep, eating, energy, concentration, and self-image.”</p>

<p> Blacks are below average for experiencing Major Depressive episodes over a 12 month span according to the study, however it does not take into consideration differences in population sizes of the various ethnic groups. American Indian/Alaska Natives are indicated as having the highest percentage of major depressive episodes, however they only account for 1.2 percent of the overall US population. It would be interesting to dig deeper into this data to establish the raw numbers that account for depressed individuals based off of the ethnic makeup of the population.</p>
