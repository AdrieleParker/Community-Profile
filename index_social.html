<h1>Black Social Users</h1>
	   </div>
	   
<h2>Intro:</h2>
<p>We’re focusing on two separate communities: The level of black social media usage across platforms and African Americans suffering from depression.</p>

<p><strong>Black Social Users Intro:</strong> Black activists influence social change using Twitter and other social media platforms. There are many social issues impacting the Black community -- including racial profiling, police brutality, the endangerment of black lives, taboo social issues and how the Black Lives Matter Movement can be inclusive of all black lives. Our data is not focused on how black social media users influence activism because it’s extremely hard to find, but we’re simply focusing on the level of black social media usage across platforms.</p>

<h2>Twitter Users by Ethnicity in 2014:</h2>

<p>The share of Twitter users of all Internet users is the most recent study conducted by Pew Research Center on social media usage by ethnicity. Compared to White (non-Hispanic) at 21 percent and Hispanic at 25 percent, Black (non-Hispanic) people use Twitter at 27 percent -- the highest of any other ethnic group in the U.S.</p>

<h2>Reddit Users by Ethnicity in 2013:</h2>

<p>The share of Reddit users of all Internet users is an interesting study to chart compared to Twitter. Black social users use the platform, which is for community forums, a little less than White social users. Clearly, Black social users use other social platforms more often than Reddit. White social users use the platform at 5 percent; Black social users use it at 4 percent; and most interesting enough Hispanic social users use it the most at 11 percent.</p>

<h2>Twitter & Other Social Users by Ethnicity & Gender in 2013:</h2>

<p>Our initial data and research indicates that the Black social users rule Twitter. The data is on social users of all Internet users by ethnicity (Black and White) and gender. The data compares Twitter and other social platforms (Facebook, LinkedIn and Google Plus) usage of Black males and White males, and Black females and white females in 2013.</p>

<p>Broken down are the specific demographics within the Black and White demographics. But overall, the Black demographic uses Twitter at 22 percent and the White demographic uses Twitter at 16 percent.</p>

<p>Pew Research Center conducted another study about the demographics of key social networking platforms a month prior, but the chart above organized and broke down each demographic more efficiently.</p>
<p>Black and White demographics use social media networks -- like Facebook, LinkedIn and Google Plus -- at a closer percentage. Although White social users use these social platforms at 1 percent lesser than Black social users, who are at 73 percent. It’s interesting to see closer numbers in usage of these social platforms compared to Twitter.</p>

<p>Overall according to the 2013 study, Black males use Twitter at 21 percent and other social platforms combined at 71 percent. White males use Twitter at 18 percent and other social platforms combined at 66 percent. Black females use Twitter at 22 percent and other social platforms combined at 74 percent. White females use Twitter at 15 percent and other social platforms combined at 77 percent.</p>

<h2>Teenage Twitter Users by Ethnicity in 2012:</h2>

<p>The share of teenage Twitter users of all Internet users in 2012 breaks down the amount of youth by ethnicity. Black (non-Hispanic) teenagers used Twitter the most at 39 percent. White (non-Hispanic) teenagers use Twitter at 23 percent; and Hispanic teenagers use Twitter at 19 percent -- the lowest out of any other teenage group in the U.S.</p>

<h2>Distribution of Twitter Employees in the United States in 2014, by Ethnicity and Department:</h2>

<p>The share of Twitter employees in the U.S. in 2014 by ethnicity and (tech, non-tech and leadership) department(s) is an unique study. Twitter conducted its own study on the distribution of employees across departments. This study is broken down by many ethnicities. White employees dominate Twitter usage in tech, non-tech and leadership at 58, 60 and 72 percent. Black employees are much lower in percentage at 1 percent for tech, 4 percent for non-tech and 2 percent for leadership. Other people of color’s percentages across departments are very similar to that of Black employees.</p>
