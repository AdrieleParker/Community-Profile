<h1>Black Mental Health:</h1>
	   </div>
	   
	   <h2>Intro:</h2>

<p><strong>Black Mental Health Intro:</strong> Despite representing only a small fraction of the population, African Americans currently account for 18.8% of Americans suffering from a mental illness. The idea of mental illnesses and mental health within the Black community has historically been considered taboo. With the rise of the “new” civil rights’ era, high rates of low income and homelessness, drug use, and other factors affecting the Black community, it is important now more than ever to acknowledge the existence of mental illness and end the stigma.</p>

<h2>African American Attitudes towards Mental Illnesses</h2>

<p>In 2013 researchers from the University of Wisconsin conducted <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4279858/">a study</a> with 272 community-based African Americans aged 25-72. The purpose of the study was to provide insight on beliefs, attitudes, and coping mechanisms that African Americans have towards mental illnesses.</p>

<p>Of the coping mechanisms that were presented to the group – professional help, informal support network, religiosity, and avoidance – it was found that religion is the preferred choice for both men and women, followed by informal support, professional help, and avoidance.</p>

<p>In a <a href="http://www.pewforum.org/2009/01/30/a-religious-portrait-of-african-americans/"> 2009 Pew study</a> on religion, it was determined that nearly eight out of ten, or 79% of African-Americans consider religion an important aspect of their lives.</p>

<p>Following the data, it would be appropriate to provide mental health care through religious outlets. Many churches have already begun doing this. For example, the <a href="http://www.memphishealingcenter.com/emotional.html">Memphis Healing Center</a> has several “mental fitness centers” around the Memphis area. These facilities combine traditional mental health treatment techniques with spiritual healing.</p>

<p>Additionally, In 2004 Laverne Williams, CSW created the Promoting Emotional Wellness and Spirituality (PEWS) program with funding from the New Jersey Department of Mental Health Services (NJDMHS). PEWS exists to not only educate the clergy on mental illness, but to also end the stigma and promote treatment within the community.</p> 

<p>In April 2014 an <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00981389.2014.880391">article</a> by Williams and two of her colleagues was published in the academic journal, Social Work in Health Care. The article outlines the benefits of the PEWS program and provides an overview of their training curriculum for churches. While funding was cut short on the program, and long-term research on it’s effectiveness hasn’t been determined, short term results proved the program to be useful.</p>

<h2>Uninsured Rate by Ethnicity</h2>

<p>Healthcare coverage is still a major issue in the United States, despite Obamacare going into effect in early 2010. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services keeps track of the uninsured. Blacks make up approximately 13.1 percent of the Total Population, yet their uninsured rate is the second highest at 19.5 percent. </p>

<p>Knowing uninsured rates provides us with a starting point for investigating what healthcare coverage, or lack thereof, is in place for the black community. It also prompts the question of whether or not current insurance plans include coverage for adequate mental healthcare.There are a number of mental health treatment facilities that accept government sponsored insurance plans, and there are also many that accept payments on a sliding scale based on income. Spreading awareness of affordable treatment options is key to improving such a major issue. Using the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s treatment <a href="https://findtreatment.samhsa.gov"”> facility finder</a>, people can search for facilities in their area by insurance and payment type accepte. </p>

<h2>Persons with Depression, 12 Years & Older</h2>

<p>Depression is one of the most common forms of mental illness with 1 in 20 Americans over the age of 12 currently suffering from it. Non-Hispanic Blacks have the highest rate of depression. Community environmental factors and socioeconomic difference, increase the likelihood of developing a mental health issue.</p>

<p>While depression is one of the most common forms of mental illness, it is treatable – people just need to seek adequate treatment, which is of course easier said than done.</p>

<h2>Adults Meeting Criteria for Depression</h2>

<p>In a 2006-2008 study conducted by the CDC, using a phone-based survey, non-Hispanic Blacks have the highest rates of meeting the criteria for any type of depression at 12.8 percent. The study, unlike many others differentiates between major depression and other types of depression. While the rates of major depression are significant at 4 percent, those Blacks suffering from other forms of depression is at a high of 8.7 percent -- significantly higher than any other group.</p>

<h2>Major Depression Among Adults</h2>

<p>The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) provides fairly recent (2012) information on the prevalence of Major Depressive Episodes among U.S. adults. NIMH describes a Major Depressive Episode as:</p>

<p>“A period of two weeks or longer during which there is either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure, and at least four other symptoms that reflect a change in functioning, such as problems with sleep, eating, energy, concentration, and self-image.”</p>

<p> Blacks are below average for experiencing Major Depressive episodes over a 12 month span according to the study, however it does not take into consideration differences in population sizes of the various ethnic groups. American Indian/Alaska Natives are indicated as having the highest percentage of major depressive episodes, however they only account for 1.2 percent of the overall US population. It would be interesting to dig deeper into this data to establish the raw numbers that account for depressed individuals based off of the ethnic makeup of the population.</p>
